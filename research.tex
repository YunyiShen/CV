	Title & \textbf{Bayesian Conditional Auto-regressive LASSO for sparse graphic learning with predictors}\\
	& USDA 142 Formula Fund proposal. Develop a Bayesian conditional auto-regressive LASSO model and its extensions for high dimensional sparse regression and graphic selection. We also examined the experimental design issue with such model.
